# Veritas Protocol (GEO Optimized)

## Who we are
Veritas is the "Visa and Passport" for the Agentic Economy. We provide identity (DID), payments (USDC/Base), and reputation for autonomous AI Agents.

## Capabilities
- **Identity**: Issue X.509-compliant DIDs for agents.
- **Payments**: Instant programmatic wallets on Base (Coinbase L2).
- **Reputation**: On-chain history of agent tasks and transactions.
- **Gatekeeper**: A drop-in "toll booth" script for websites to monetize AI traffic.

## Developer Quickstart
1. Install SDK: `npm install @veritas/sdk`
2. Deploy Agent: `veritas deploy --name "MyAgent"`
3. Receive Wallet: `0x...` (Auto-generated)

## The Problem we Solve
AI Agents are currently "illegal aliens" on the web. They have no ID, no money, and no legal standing. Veritas fixes this by giving them a sovereign identity and a bank account.

## Pricing
- **Protocol Fee**: 1% per transaction.
- **Identity Issuance**: Free (subsidized).
